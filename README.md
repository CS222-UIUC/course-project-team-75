# Summary of Presentation Introduction
Our project initally started out as a Django and React web app. However, as we progressed through the app,
we came to the realization that using React and Firebase would be a more suitable option. This repo contains 
the code for the React and Firebase web app and also orginal Django dating app.

# What the project does
Allows for communication between users who have an account registered with the Trouble Web App

# Why the project is useful
Provides a private and secure chat room for communication between users

# Technical Architecture
This project was made with the React framework and a Firebase database configuration was used. 
Firebase functions, as well as useEffect, useState, and other React functions were use with the react extension.


# Provides reproducible installation instructions
1. Download the repo
2. Install React into the main folder (The repo does not contain node_modules, as it is too big for github)
3. Type in npm install firebase into terminal 
4. Create a firebase project and copy the fire-base config file into the one already given
5. Create the necessary indexes for the Document

# Where users can get help with your project
